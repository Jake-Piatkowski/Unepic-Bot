# Unepic-Bot
A simple bot for farming kills for the "The Graveyard is overloaded" achievement.

The idea is taken from this link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=475885704

The thing you have to do is create the portal as shown in the video, then assign Heat to 1, Teleport to Portal to 2 and Teleport to Cube to 3.

Then, run the game, make sure Single Player is highlighted in the menu, then run this bot and maximise the game.
